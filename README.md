# SGSSS Summer School 2025: Archives for Justice with Dr Galina Oustinova-Stjepanovic, University of Glasgow

Monday 23rd June 

The session examines how archives are used and assembled to promote social and criminal justice. Starting with a theoretical discussion of non-representational and collaborative methodologies and their temporalities, the session challenges the privileged status of the archive in creating truth-claims about the past or now. Instead, the session looks into ways to harness archival authority to pursue fugitive justice, or difficult to envisage, let alone achieve, redress. The workshop moves away from documentary methodologies of reading, writing, and analysing historical materials to emancipatory, praxis-oriented methodologies of human rights activists, conflict archives, as well as community and indigenous production of archives.

***IMPORTANT: Sensitivity note***

This session deals with conflict and violence, which can be emotionally challenging.   
Archives are steeped in violence, and the session tackles some difficult past and ongoing massacre in Palestine.
